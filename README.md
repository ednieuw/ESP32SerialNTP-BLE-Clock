# ESP32SerialNTP-BLE-Clock
Feed ATMEGA B/W Word clock with NTP time  

The Word clock with white 2835 or 3528 LEDs run on a ATMEGA 328 and keeps it time in a DS3231 Module.
This word clock can receive its time with a DCF77 receiver. But this will not work with clock with brass copper or corten steel word plates.

This code with run on an ESP32 C3 and S3 and probably other boards. 
The first versions will run on a ESP32-S3-Zero and C3-mini. 
The final version will also be suited for the Arduino nano ESP32. A board that will probably be avaiable for many years after this year 2024
